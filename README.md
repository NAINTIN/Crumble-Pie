# Crumble-Pie
Website for The Crumble Pie Local Business

Crumble Pie started around 2021 as a small family business passed down through generations. The owner learned how to bake pies from his uncle, continuing the family’s passion for homemade desserts. Since the owner is still a student, the business operates on a pre-order basis rather than having a physical store. This setup allows them to manage their time efficiently while maintaining the quality of their baked goods.
Orders are collected from Monday to Wednesday and served every Friday, accommodating around 20 or more customers each month. At first, Crumble Pie offered only three pie flavors, but due to growing demand and creativity, the menu has expanded to five delicious flavors. In addition to pies, they now also make tarts, giving customers more options to enjoy their handcrafted treats.
